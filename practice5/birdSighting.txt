44)Migratory Birds


Given an array of bird sightings where every element represents a bird type id, determine the id of the most frequently sighted type. If more than 1 type has been spotted that maximum amount, return the smallest of their ids.


Example
arr =[1,1,2,2,3]
There are two each of types 1 and 2, and one sighting of type 3 . Pick the lower of the two types seen twice: type 1 .

Sample Input

6
1 4 4 4 5 3

sample Output

4


Explanation 

The different types of birds occur in the following frequencies:

Type 1:1  bird
Type 2:0  birds
Type 3:1 bird
Type 4:3 birds
Type 5:1 bird

The type number that occurs at the highest frequency is type 4, so we print 4 as our answer.

ans ).function mostFrequentBird(arr) {
    let birdMap = {};
    let maxFreq = 0;
    let mostFrequentBird = arr[0];

    // Count frequency of each bird type
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (birdMap[arr[i]]) {
            birdMap[arr[i]]++;
        } else {
            birdMap[arr[i]] = 1;
        }
        // Update the most frequent bird and its frequency
        if (birdMap[arr[i]] > maxFreq || (birdMap[arr[i]] === maxFreq && arr[i] < mostFrequentBird)) {
            mostFrequentBird = arr[i];
            maxFreq = birdMap[arr[i]];
        }
    }

    return mostFrequentBird;
}

// Sample input
let arr = [1, 4, 4, 4, 5, 3];
console.log(mostFrequentBird(arr)); // Output: 4
