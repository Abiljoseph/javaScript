k= 7

The budget is 7 units of currency.he can buy  items that cost[1,2,3]  for 6, or[3,4]  for 7 units. The maximum is 3 items.

Function Description

Complete the function maximumToys in the editor below.

maximumToys has the following parameter(s):

int prices[n]: the toy prices
int k: Mark's budget
Returns

int: the maximum number of toys

Sample Input

7 50
1 12 5 111 200 1000 10

Sample Output

4



Explanation

He can buy only 4 toys at most. These toys have the following prices: 1,12,5,10.

ans). function maximumToys(prices, k) {
    // Sort the toy prices in ascending order
    prices.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    let totalCost = 0;
    let toyCount = 0;
    
    // Iterate through the sorted toy prices
    for (let price of prices) {
        // Check if the total cost plus the current toy price is within the budget
        if (totalCost + price <= k) {
            // Increment the total cost by the current toy price
            totalCost += price;
            // Increment the toy count
            toyCount++;
        } else {
            // Break the loop if we cannot buy more toys with the remaining budget
            break;
        }
    }
    
    return toyCount;
}

// Test the function with the given sample input
const prices = [1, 12, 5, 111, 200, 1000, 10];
const k = 50;
console.log(maximumToys(prices, k)); // Output: 4
